Pelagicorized version of arkose-dbus-proxy

For ubuntu, you'll want the libdbus-glib-1-dev package installed

To run the proxy, make it, and then try:
./arkose-dbus-proxy /tmp/my_proxy_socket bus-type profiles/pelagicore.conf
                      ^- Socket to create for communication
                                          ^- "session" or "system"
                                                   ^- Our config

You can then interact with the socket via, for instance, d-feet. You'll notice
that you can read introspection data since the org.freedesktop namespace is
allowed, and you can also interact with gedit (since this is also allowed in
the config). You can't do much else.
